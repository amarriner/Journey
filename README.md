*Python script(s) to generate a novel-length (50,000 word) text for [NaNoGenMo 14](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014)*

The idea behind this book is the narrator is a scientist exploring a vast network of caves. Each chapter of the book 
represents a tier or floor of this stucture. Each chapter builds a random maze layout and then drops the narrator 
into the maze. They describe the directions they take as they navigate the maze and describe things they see along 
the way. The narrator is ostensibly cataloging flora and fauna.

The script generates the requisite number of words right now, but it's (obviously) pretty repetative. I'm working on 
making it *slightly* more natural as well as adding more optional and random encounters/happenings. As well as, 
perhaps, more complex events occurring in a single square of a given floor.
