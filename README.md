# Journey

*Python script(s) to generate a novel-length (50,000 word) text for [NaNoGenMo 14](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014)*

The idea behind this book is the narrator is an adventurer of some sort exploring a vast network of caves. Each chapted of the book represents a tier or floor of this stucture. 
Each chapter builds a random maze layout and then drops the narrator into the maze. They describe the directions they take as they navigate the maze and describe things they 
see along the way.

The script generates the requisite number of words right now, but it's (obviously) pretty repetative. I'm working on making it *slightly* more natural as well as adding more 
optional and random encounters/happenings. As well as, perhaps, more complex events occurring in a single square of a given floor.
